"""Harness: dashboard opt-in via CRYOZEN_DASHBOARD.

Today (tini): dashboard starts once when CRYOZEN_DASHBOARD=1; if it crashes
it stays dead. After Phase 2 (s6): dashboard starts once; if it crashes
it is restarted under supervision. The restart-after-crash test lives in
Phase 2 Task 2.5; this file only locks the opt-in surface (which must
not change between tini and s6).

Every ``docker exec`` here runs as the unprivileged ``cryozen`` user
(via :func:`docker_exec`/:func:`docker_exec_sh` in conftest), matching
the realistic runtime context. See the conftest module docstring.

    """The s6 dashboard run script must NOT auto-add ``--insecure`` when the
    dashboard binds to ``0.0.0.0``. The auth gate engages on its own when a
    ``DashboardAuthProvider`` is registered (the bundled basic provider
    activates whenever ``CRYOZEN_DASHBOARD_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME`` and a
    password are set).

    Regression guard: before this fix, the run script flipped ``--insecure``
    on for any non-loopback bind, which routed ``start_server`` straight back
    into the legacy ``allow_public=True`` branch and disabled the gate every
    time.

    We verify two independent observable consequences of the gate being
    on:

    1. ``/api/auth/providers`` (publicly reachable through the gate so
       the login page can bootstrap) returns 200 with ``basic`` in the
       provider list, which proves the bundled provider registered.
    2. ``/api/sessions`` (a gated route under both the legacy
       ``_SESSION_TOKEN`` middleware and the auth gate) returns 401
       to an unauthenticated caller, which proves the gate is actively
       intercepting browser traffic. We deliberately probe a gated route
       here rather than ``/api/status``: status sits in the shared
       ``PUBLIC_API_PATHS`` allowlist (liveness probe target) and
       responds 200 without a cookie under both gates, so it cannot
