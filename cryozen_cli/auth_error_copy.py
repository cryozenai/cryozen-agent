"""Plain-language copy for sign-in and provider-setup failures (CLI).

One table of ``(predicate, lead sentence)`` classifies an exception into a sentence a first-time
user can act on; the raw exception is demoted to a ``Details:`` line so nothing is lost for
support. Callers print ``sign_in_failure_lines(...)`` / ``provider_setup_failure_lines(...)``
line by line.
